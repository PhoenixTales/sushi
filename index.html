    <h1>Sueski<br>
        is a liar</h1>

    <h2>EN | <s>PL</s> | <s>RU</s> | <s>DE</s></h2>

    <p>You got fooled by Sueski, an unreal little gangster and his racist gang which is spreading lies about others in the internet since they learned to use a keyboard.<br>
    Whatever negative non-sense you heard about one of the people listed below is most likely based on their hateful accusations. Believing them is dumb. It is recommended to get yourself a better source of information.</p>

    <p>Maybe they will grow up one day and stop being attention whores with a compulsive masturbatory cyber-mobbing disorder, but until then feel free to share this website when and wherever their lies are being reproduced.</p>

        <summary>Examples of what they are doing...</summary>
        <ol>
            <li>In the meanwhile, "Sueski" has become a meme and is associated more with his followers and his associated group than with his person in particular.</li>

            <li>They have been the reason for a lot of toxicity within the community of the video game GOTHIC. For instance, they have openly demanded for <em>violence</em> against the people mentioned above that they hate for no reason other than their own conspiracy theories. They are also known for using nazi terminology and imagery (while being polish themselves...) with always re-occuring wordings such as "jewish" as an insult and other antisemitic moves (once they have used real photographic portraits of a polish journalist combined with a Star of David while accusing him of his "jewish" greed).</li>

            <li>They attempt to get access to Alpha Versions and other undisclosed material by insidious means in order to leak it. This has caused psychological distress to some former GOTHIC developers, it reduced the chances of any further sharing of such material with the community and has been impeding for negotiations of a legal publication of said material. On top of all these consequences they have tried to blame people for their leaks which have nothing to do with it, such as <em>Bloody/Peter</em>, <em>Flosha</em> and <em>Vaana</em>.</li>

            <li>They insult everyone as "greedy communists" which do not blindly leak software they were entrusted with, such as <a href="https://phoenixtales.de">Phoenix Tales</a>. Phoenix Tales received some Alpha Versions from various sources for free - to help in their development of the Phoenix Project - and they're not yet allowed to publish them (inspite of wishing to do so); the same people created the <a href="https://gothicarchive.org">Gothic Archive</a> and digitised hundreds of design documents, sharing more with the GOTHIC community than anybody else - and nonetheless they try to frame them as "greedy".</li> 

            <li>They accuse people of making money with videos about Alpha Versions of GOTHIC on YouTube, while they don't, such as Dmitriy aka Phantom95 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alpharesearcher">AlphaResearcher</a>), being the number one ressource of research and videos about early versions of this game. His videos are non-commercialised; but jealousy (due to him having access to material for documentation purposes that others do not) leads them to all kinds of accusations in order to let Dmitriy appear in a bad light, while nothing of it is true.</li>

            <li>They call their inner cirlce "GUSM", <em>Grupa Uderzeniowa Sueskiego Mistrza</em>, which means as much as "Strike Group of Mr. Sushiface". The people in this group are known under nicknames such as <em>Zakker</em>, <em>Hanibal</em>, <em></em>Ryzownika aka Somsiad</em>, <em>Whitie</em> and others, as well as for associated channels under their control such as Kanał Panamski, Kanał Rolewski and Kanał Sueski.</li>

            <li>A bigger group surrounding this inner circle is called "BSMKWKW". They are developing a modification based on the original Gothic Sequel that they leaked in 2017. In 2023 their own project was leaked to the public. Apparently the asocial justice warriors did not find it so just when they were affected by a leak themselves. Some of them were so amused that they've send death threats to those who claimed to be responsible.</li>

            <li>Their group is best described as a gang. A little racist cyber gang, which members, according to secret service, are most likely operating from within their moms basement. They have a Discord server, where Sushikind has the role of the "Führer", glorifying the Third Reich, which was responsible for the death of around six million Poles (remember, they are Poles themselves). National-socialist imagery and gore has been shared there on a regular basis. They spread their hatred on YouTube via different channels, by trolling on various Discord servers and in form of spam in comment sections.</li>

            <li>Please keep in mind who you put your trust into by getting any of their leaks. Just as these liars are not a reliable source of information, they are surely not a trustworthy source to download files from, which may be modified (and have been modified in the past) in malicious ways.</li>
